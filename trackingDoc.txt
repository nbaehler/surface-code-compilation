Questions:
- What is the return value of a joint Bell measurement? -> I should know, or ask in person, as I side question, get more info
  For joint Pauli measurement we only get Zero or One back ... which are the two possible eigenvalues with the two associated sub vector spaces.
  XX -> 00, 11 - -1 = 0, 01, 10 - +1 = 1
  Here it is the parity
- What is the input and the output format of the compiler? QIR?
- How do I pick any of the parameters? Grid size/shape, matching ... (I remember 4*5, and then 8*10 such that a mapping is always possible)
  -> start small = size of the number of qubits in the input circuit but as square as possible,
  -> then extend if needed (assumes that there are as many vertical and horizontal constraints)
  -> matching: at first random!, then exchange qubits etc. with functions: exchange(i, j)
  -> how do I know how many ancilla qubits I should add?
- When do we meet generally?
- Opportunities at Microsoft?

TODO:
- Debug moves (and swap)
- Fix the return type (Result, Result[]) of the Bell measurement

Future:
- Add passes to check for parallelism opportunities
- Extend with more than just CNOT?


-----------------------------------------
Input: array of cnot gates (as indices), grid dimensions, use Pyqir evaluator to extract array
Output: mapping (qubit to) and a scheduling array of array PyQir generator, add custom operators
