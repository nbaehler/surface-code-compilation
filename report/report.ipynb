    "seems very different from quantum circuits, how we know and love them! But there\n",
    "is reason to this ‘madness’. Surface codes, a special kind of Error Correcting\n",
    "Codes, hold the promise to make fault-tolerant and large-scale quantum computing\n",
    "possible (in the near future, of course …). The basic idea behind surface codes\n",
    "is simple. Assume a planar grid of qubits and only neighbor interactions between\n",
    "qubits are possible. Square patches of _physical_ qubits, are conceptually\n",
    "combined into one _logical_ qubit in a way that makes this logical qubit error\n",
    "correctable. The physical qubits inside a patch are split up into data qubits\n",
    "and ancilla qubits. Through a set of smart measurements of the ancilla qubits\n",
    "only, one can infer errors that might have occurred on the data qubits, which\n",
    "can then be corrected. In the picture above, each cell of the gray chessboard\n",
    "represents one such logical qubit. On top of that fault-tolerant structure, one\n",
    "can build a set of gates, the elementary ones depicted quite colorfully above.\n",
    "By composing multiple elementary gates, the gate set can be extended to be\n",
    "universal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Universality of the gate set](#universality-of-the-gate-set)\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to implement the preparations and measurements of individual qubits in\n",
    "the computational basis (Z basis), controlled-not (CNOT), Pauli-X, -Y, and -Z,\n",
    "Hadamard (H), Phase S and T gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of elementary surface code operations allows to directly implement all\n",
    "but the Pauli and phase gates. As Pauli gates commute with the remaining gates,\n",
    "we can track them classically and adapt the final measurements accordingly.\n",
    "Hence, no need to implement those physically. In order to also implement the\n",
    "phase gates, we rely on a technique that was given a most suiting name: _Magic\n",
    "State Distillation_.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique uses highly specialized circuit sections, called _Magic State\n",
    "Factories_, which can be in a region of the 2D grid of logical qubits far apart\n",
    "from the main section where the quantum algorithm is implemented. In those\n",
    "factories, initial low quality quantum states are repeatedly processed to\n",
    "improve their quality until the resulting state is close enough to a target\n",
    "state, hence the term ‘distillation’. Consuming such magic states, both phase\n",
    "gates (S and T) can be fabricated. For S and T gates to be useable in the\n",
    "quantum circuit, though, we still face one challenge: How do we ‘transport’\n",
    "those magic states from their factories (potentially in a far away region of the\n",
    "grid) to the location where we need them to implement either of the phase gates?\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is closely related to another aspect of the surface code\n",
    "architecture. As opposed to conventional quantum circuits, geometrical\n",
    "constraints are taken into account here. What do we do if a two-qubit operation\n",
    "has to be performed between two qubits which are physically far apart from each\n",
    "other? The simplest idea is to use a bunch of SWAP gates (can be easily\n",
    "implemented using two move operations) to bring the two quantum states, the\n",
    "operands of the two-qubit operation, physically close together. But there is a\n",
    "catch, we require $Ω(n)$ SWAP gates, where $n$ is the distance between the\n",
    "operands, to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we do something smarter? The answer is yes, but it comes at the cost of some\n",
    "compilation complexity! I’m going to illustrate this with the example of\n",
    "long-range CNOTs, meaning CNOTs between physically distant qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Compilation of long-range CNOTs](#compilation-of-long-range-cnots)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let’s look at how a local CNOT can be expressed in terms of elementary\n",
    "operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](figures/local_cnot.png)\\\n",
    "_The arrow (at a for example) indicates that\n",
    "the result of a measurement is stored classically in a variable, which can then\n",
    "be used to conditionally perform additional operations if the variable equals\n",
    "$|1⟩$, indicated by the equal sign (at b for example). The CNOT additionally\n",
    "consumes a $|+⟩$ state. [\\[1\\]](#references)_\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea, to extend this circuitry to support long-range without using SWAP\n",
    "gates, is to entangle the operands using Bell preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](figures/long_range_cnot.png)\\\n",
    "_In this figure, the Pauli corrections are\n",
    "omitted and just hidden inside the f-expression, which is conditioned on all\n",
    "the measuring results. [\\[1\\]](#references)_\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the constant depth of the circuit, although $|ϕ⟩$ and $|ψ⟩$ can be far\n",
    "apart! But those entangled chains add geometrical complexity. When going back\n",
    "to the 2D grid structure of logical qubits, the Bell chains can be seen as paths\n",
    "from target to control qubits on the grid. Further, we’d like to execute\n",
    "operations in parallel. Hence, intersections with other Bell chains have to be\n",
    "avoided, otherwise we would mess up the entanglement. This is the additional\n",
    "twist in the compilation pass!\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our lives easier, we are subdividing the 2D grid of logical qubits into\n",
    "data and ancilla qubits. CNOTs can only be performed on data qubits, where the\n",
    "ancillas are going to enable the Bell chains between the control and the target\n",
    "qubit, also referred to as terminals. Further, we can define a graph structure,\n",
    "called _Operator Graph_, highlight in blue below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](figures/operator_paths.png.png)\\\n",
    "_Black squares are data qubits, the other ones\n",
    "are ancilla qubits. Further, control data qubits (B4 for example) are only\n",
    "vertically connected to its neighboring ancillas, similarly target data qubits\n",
    "(D2 for example) are only adjacent to their neighbors vertically. These\n",
    "limitations are due to the nature of the underling surface code.\n",
    "[\\[1\\]](#references)_\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume now that we want to execute a bunch of CNOTs. In a first step, we want to\n",
    "connect as many of the terminals with edge-disjoint paths in the operator graph\n",
    "as possible, as all those CNOTs will be executable in parallel. Note that no\n",
    "data qubit can be part of the interior of the paths, and each terminal can only\n",
    "be part of one path. Should a data qubit be used multiple times, there is no way\n",
    "of running those CNOTs in parallel. They will have to be run in sequential\n",
    "phases that I call epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](figures/paths.png)\\\n",
    "_An example of one epoch containing each data\n",
    "qubit at most once in any path and being connected via edge-disjoint paths over\n",
    "ancilla qubits only. [\\[1\\]](#references)_\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we still have a problem, remember when I said that those entangled Bell\n",
    "chains between terminals can’t intersection each other? But that’s exactly what\n",
    "we have here, look at E5 above for example. In a next step, we need to cut up\n",
    "and divide the paths into two phases in a way that all path segments in each of\n",
    "the two phases are vertex-disjoint. This ensures that no Bell chains intersect\n",
    "each other, at least in the same phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](figures/phases_paths.png)\\\n",
    "_An example of one epoch that has been split up\n",
    "into two phases, ensuring vertex-disjoint paths. [\\[1\\]](#references)_\n",
    "\n",
    "We maximally need two phases per epoch (we might get lucky and have only none\n",
    "overlapping paths in a given epoch) and we have seen that each CNOT can be run\n",
    "in constant depth. Hence, each phase has constant depth as well and, thus, we\n",
    "are limited by the number of epochs. This number is intrinsic to the (re)usage\n",
    "and of data qubits. There is no dependence on the distance between terminals,\n",
    "and we can run many CNOTs in parallel. This is a big leap!\n",
    "\n",
    "The same idea of using such Bell chains can be applied to transporting the\n",
    "aforementioned magic states from their factories to the location on the grid\n",
    "where we need to implement phase gates, thus, also at constant depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper, the main algorithm combines this procedure described above with a\n",
    "greedy algorithm based on shortest paths and finally picks the result from the\n",
    "one that produces fewer epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Further optimizations](#further-optimizations)\n",
    "\n",
    "One can think of further optimizations steps, that are not discussed in the\n",
    "paper. One idea would be to compute a smart mapping of qubits onto the grid,\n",
    "which leads to shorter paths and fewer intersections. Another one is instruction\n",
    "reordering, similar to what modern CPUs do to improve instruction level\n",
    "parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Conclusion](#conclusion)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of my project is to finally compile down all those operations into Q#\n",
    "code, which would allow comparing the optimized version with an untouched\n",
    "version of the circuit via simulation and check correctness and performance\n",
    "uplift. But this will actually be tricky as the surface code, even ignoring the\n",
    "fact that each logical qubit is composed of multiple physical qubits, requires\n",
    "many qubits …\n",
    "\n",
    "This fact allows me to draw a nice final conclusion. The technique I sketched\n",
    "out for you is fascinating, but it needs many qubits. As new quantum chips with\n",
    "more and more qubits are being develop at an every increasing pace, I think the\n",
    "in a ‘near future’, surface codes will be the basis of fault-tolerant large\n",
    "scale quantum computing. And hence, surface code compilation is a ‘hot topic’ to\n",
    "work on right now! I hope that I could spark your interest on the matter!\n",
